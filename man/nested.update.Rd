\title{Update procD.lm objects with nested effects}
\usage{
nested.update(P, f1)
}
\arguments{
\item{P}{A \code{\link{procD.lm}} object}

\item{f1}{A right-hand or full formula for one factor nested within another; e.g., ~ A/B}
}
\description{
This function is used to update \code{\link{procD.lm}} objects for fixed effects with 
nested random effects (nested design).
}
\details{
This functions serves as a helper function when linear models have nested (hierarchical) structure.  It is used on
\code{\link{procD.lm}} objects that were formerly evaluated with type I sums of squares (SS), as is typical
with models with only fixed effects.  Using a formula for nested effects, this function identifies the fixed and random
SS in the random outcomes used to generate the \code{\link{procD.lm}} object, and updates the F-values,
Z-scores, and P-values based on F values adjusted to be MS fixed/MS random (nested).  This is accomplished by 
generating random values for each iteration previously used in the \code{\link{procD.lm}} object.

This function can be used recursively for multiple updates, when multiple nested effects are used.  The function can
currently only handle single factors nestd within other single factors.

Function returns the same list as \code{\link{procD.lm}} but with random F values appended.  The 
ANOVA table is updated in terms of F-values, Z-scores, and P-values,

\examples{

# This example is intended as a demonstration; it is not intended to suggest
# that populatons should normally be nested within gender.

data(pupfish)
gdf <- geomorph.data.frame(coords = pupfish$coords, pop=pupfish$Pop, sex = pupfish$Sex)
pupfishANOVA <- procD.lm(coords ~ sex/pop, iter=999, RRPP=TRUE, data=gdf)
summary(pupfishANOVA)

# Update for nested effects
pupfishANOVA <- nested.update(pupfishANOVA, ~sex/pop)
summary(pupfishANOVA)

# One needs to be careful using this function!

gdf <- geomorph.data.frame(coords = pupfish$coords, pop=pupfish$Pop, sex = pupfish$Sex, 
CS = pupfish$CS)
pupfishANOVA <- procD.lm(coords ~ CS * sex/pop, iter=499, RRPP=TRUE, data=gdf)
summary(pupfishANOVA)

# This will not work: pupfishANOVA <- nested.update(pupfishANOVA, ~sex/pop) 
# The updated terms must be included as part of the original terms

pupfishANOVA <- procD.lm(coords ~ CS + CS*sex + sex/pop, iter=499, RRPP=TRUE, data=gdf)
summary(pupfishANOVA)

# Now the format will allow an update

pupfishANOVA <- nested.update(pupfishANOVA, ~sex/pop) 

summary(pupfishANOVA)
