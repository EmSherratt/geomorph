## Resubmission
This is a major release, 4.0.0, that accompanies a major  update to the `RRPP` to version 1.0.0. The package, `RRPP`, is developed by the same authors as `geomorph`. `RRPP 1.0.0` and `geomorph 4.0.0` are to be concurrently updated and released.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.3
* win-builder (devel and release)
* R-hub (all platforms)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of geomorph. All packages that I could install passed.
